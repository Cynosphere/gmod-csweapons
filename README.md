=====================================================

Counter-Strike: Source-esque weapons for Garry's Mod.

This addon tries to faithfully recreate the counter strike source weapons we all love ( and hate ).

=====================================================

Progress so far:

CSBase completed.
CSBaseGun is missing zooming and shotgun related code.
AK47 completed.
M249 completed.
Glock almost completed, only the burstfire needs to be the same as the original.
